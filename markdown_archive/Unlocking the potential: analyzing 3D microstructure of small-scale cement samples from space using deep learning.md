## Abstract
Due to the prohibitive cost of transporting raw materials into Space, in-situ materials along with cement-like binders are poised to be employed for extraterrestrial construction. A unique methodology for obtaining microstructural topology of cement samples hydrated in microgravity environment at the International Space Station (ISS) is presented here. Distinctive Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) micrographs of hardened tri-calcium silicate (C3S) samples were used as exemplars in a deep learning-based microstructure reconstruction framework. The hydrated space-returned samples exhibited higher porosity content (~70 %) with the portlandite phase assuming an elongated plate-like morphology.

## Introduction
Sustainable human space expeditions require infrastructure on extraterrestrial bodies to protect humans and equipment. In-situ resources such as lunar regolith formed into cement-like binders are envisioned for constructing habitats. Tricalcium silicate (C3S) constitutes ~50–70% of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) and governs its hydration. Understanding its microstructural formation in microgravity is essential for predicting mechanical properties.

## Methods

### Process parameters - C3S hydration in microgravity and ground
- **Mixture:** C3S mixed with lime-water at a water-to-cement (w/c) ratio of 2.0.
- **Environment:** ISS (microgravity, μg) and Earth (1g).
- **Conditions:** 20 ± 2 °C, 1 ATM, 35% relative humidity.
- **Duration:** 42 days of hydration aboard the ISS.

### Deep learning-based microstructure reconstruction
A CNN-based generative network (solid texture synthesis) was used to generate 3D virtual volumes from 2D SEM images. The framework utilized VGG-19 as a pre-trained descriptor network to ensure statistical equivalency between 2D exemplars and 3D reconstructions.

## Results

### Phase Composition and Porosity
| Phase | Ground (1g) (%) | Microgravity (μg) (%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Porosity | 47.0 ± 14.2 | 70.3 ± 1.4 |
| Porosity - MIP | 48.4 | 69.4 |
| C-S-H | 41.6 ± 12.0 | 21.2 ± 1.2 |
| CH (Portlandite) | 11.3 ± 2.8 | 8.5 ± 1.4 |

### Microstructural Findings
- **Portlandite (CH) Morphology:** In 1g, CH crystals are uniformly distributed. In μg, they assume an elongated plate-like morphology due to the lack of buoyancy-driven convection.
- **Porosity:** μg samples showed significantly higher porosity (~70%) compared to 1g samples (~47%).
- **Validation:** The deep learning model successfully captured the unique topology of both 1g and μg samples, validated against micro-CT data and statistical descriptors.

## Conclusion
The study demonstrates that AI-assisted reconstruction can effectively characterize the 3D microstructure of extraterrestrial construction materials from limited 2D samples. This is vital for establishing process-microstructure-property linkages for materials used in space architecture.
